#' Set percent-based representation targets for conservation features
#'
#' In a Marxan-like reserve design exercise, all conservation features need
#' representation targets. Often these targets are set as some percentage of the
#' total level of representation the features within the study area. This
#' function converts percent-based targets into absolute targets in preparation
#' for a reserve design exercise.
#'
#' @param features RasterStack of the distribution of features over the study
#'   area or a numeric vector giving the total representation level of the
#'   feature in the study area.
#' @param targets numeric vector of percent-based targets for each conservation
#'   feature. Values must be between 0 and 1, and the length of the vector must
#'   be either 1, to set the same proportional target for all features, or equal
#'   to the number of features.
#'
#' @return A numeric vector of targets. If \code{features} was named, then the
#'   returned vector of targets will also be named.
